## React Native

A project-based journey of me learning React Native. An Awesome library for Awesome projects ahead.

### Day 1:
- Development environment Setup
- Learning Expo tools, caveats
- Learning Views. The basic building block of UI in React Native: TextInput, Image, Text etc
- Learning what core components are, examples
- Learning native components

### Day 2:
- Made a Todo list
  - How to dismiss a keyboard.
  - Interacted with ScrollableView, TouchableOpacity Component
- Learnt the flexbox basics
  - A flex of 1 allows an element to take up the space available on the screen
  - When the element's content overflows, the parent container becomes scrollable after specifying a flex of 1
